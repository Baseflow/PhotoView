PhotoView aims to help produce an easily usable implementation of a zooming Android ImageView.

## Features
- Out of the box zooming, using multi-touch and double-tap.
- Scrolling, with smooth scrolling fling.
- Works perfectly when using used in a scrolling parent (such as ViewPager).
- Allows the application to be notified when the displayed Matrix has changed. Useful for when you need to update your UI based on the current zoom/scroll position.
- Allows the application to be notified when the user taps on the Photo.

## Sample Application
The sample application (the source is in the repository) has been published onto Google Play for easy access:

[![Get it on Google Play](http://www.android.com/images/brand/get_it_on_play_logo_small.png)](http://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.senab.photoview.sample)

## Gradle integration

Minimum code for Gradle integration, place code in your `build.gradle`

```gradle
dependencies {
  compile 'com.github.chrisbanes.photoview:library:+'
}
```

## Sample Usage
There is a [sample](https://github.com/chrisbanes/PhotoView/tree/master/sample) provided which shows how to use the library in a more advanced way, but for completeness here is all that is required to get PhotoView working:

```java
ImageView mImageView;
PhotoViewAttacher mAttacher;

@Override
public void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
	super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
	setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
	
	// Any implementation of ImageView can be used!
	mImageView = (ImageView) findViewById(R.id.iv_photo);
	
	// Set the Drawable displayed
	Drawable bitmap = getResources().getDrawable(R.drawable.wallpaper);
	mImageView.setImageDrawable(bitmap);

	// Attach a PhotoViewAttacher, which takes care of all of the zooming functionality.
	mAttacher = new PhotoViewAttacher(mImageView);
}


// If you later call mImageView.setImageDrawable/setImageBitmap/setImageResource/etc then you just need to call
mAttacher.update();
```
